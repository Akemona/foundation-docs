# Frequently Asked Questions

**Frequently asked questions related to the Akemona Foundation.**

## Why is Akemona launching the Akemona Foundation?

Akemona has been a leader in digital securities issuance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization since 2018, providing SEC-compliant solutions to financial institutions and businesses.

To drive the adoption of RWA tokenization, we are making our intellectual property, specifically EVM smart contracts and the Akemona protocol, open source through the Akemona Foundation. However, open-source projects often face a free-rider problem, where users wait for each other to contribute ideas and effort.

To address the free-rider problem, the Akemona Foundation is a not-for-profit entity responsible for licensing and managing the Akemona RWA Tokenization platform for the benefit of entrepreneurs, businesses, and financial institutions across the world. The Foundation has released the Akemona Protocol and smart contract source code under a limited Business Source License. The Foundation is launching a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The AKENRO token holders can stake their AKENRO tokens (Akemona Nurturing RWA Opportunities) to become members of the DAO and participate in the governance of the Foundation and development of the RWA protocol. Akemona Technologies, the current owner of the Akemona RWA Tokenization Platform, will license the Platform and its source code to the Foundation, which oversees its technical development and expansion under the direction of the DAO.

Akemona Foundation sub-licenses the Akemona RWA Tokenization Platform to eligible entrepreneurs, businesses, and financial institutions at discounted rates.
