# Frequently Asked Questions

**Frequently asked questions related to the Akemona Foundation.**

## What is the relationship Between Akemona Foundation and Akemona Technologies?

Akemona Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organization established to advance the adoption of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and to support global entrepreneurship. While it collaborates with other entities in the Akemona ecosystem, it operates independently.

Akemona Foundation is **legally and operationally separate** from both **Akemona, Inc.** and **Akemona TA Services, LLC** (doing business as **Akemona Technologies**), which are for-profit entities. Akemona Foundation is not owned, controlled, or managed by either of these companies.

To ensure the long-term decentralization and sustainability of the Akemona protocol, the Akemona Foundation has entered into agreements with Akemona Technologies to support the **open-sourcing of the Akemona smart contracts and protocol**. This agreement allows the Akemona protocol to evolve as an **open-source, community-governed decentralized finance (DeFi) project**.

Under these agreements:

* The **Akemona DAO**, composed of staked \$AKENRO token holders, will play a central role in shaping the protocol’s future direction.
* The DAO will be empowered to influence development priorities, governance standards, and technical upgrades through a transparent voting process.
* The DAO will also elect at least one director to serve on the **Board of the Akemona Foundation**, ensuring that community governance is embedded in the Foundation’s structure.

In addition to its governance role, the Akemona Foundation acts as a **non-profit distributor and licensing partner** for the Akemona RWA Tokenization Platform. Through this program, the Foundation offers access to the platform at cost to eligible entrepreneurs, businesses, and financial institutions whose projects aim to improve quality of life worldwide.

This structure ensures that while Akemona Technologies contributes technical support and operational expertise, the **Akemona Foundation remains neutral, mission-driven, and community-focused**—serving as the steward of the Akemona ecosystem for the benefit of all stakeholders.

## Why is Akemona launching the Akemona Foundation?

Akemona has been a leader in digital securities issuance and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization since 2018, providing SEC-compliant solutions to financial institutions and businesses.

To drive the adoption of RWA tokenization, we are making our intellectual property, specifically EVM smart contracts and the Akemona protocol, open source through the Akemona Foundation. However, open-source projects often face a free-rider problem, where users wait for each other to contribute ideas and effort.

To address the free-rider problem, the Akemona Foundation is a not-for-profit entity responsible for licensing and managing the Akemona RWA Tokenization platform for the benefit of entrepreneurs, businesses, and financial institutions across the world. The Foundation has released the Akemona Protocol and smart contract source code under a limited Business Source License. The Foundation is launching a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The AKENRO token holders can stake their AKENRO tokens (Akemona Nurturing RWA Opportunities) to become members of the DAO and participate in the governance of the Foundation and development of the RWA protocol. Akemona Technologies, the current owner of the Akemona RWA Tokenization Platform, will license the Platform and its source code to the Foundation, which oversees its technical development and expansion under the direction of the DAO.

Akemona Foundation sub-licenses the Akemona RWA Tokenization Platform to eligible entrepreneurs, businesses, and financial institutions at discounted rates.
