# Why Akemona

## Background

Akemona has developed a powerful end-to-end digital asset issuance and management platform that supports both the sell-side and buy-side of the digital asset ecosystem in the primary market. The solution enables the issuance and investment in tokenized securities and utility tokens under SEC exemptions and the Investment Company Act of 1940.

Using the Akemona platform, issuers can raise capital through digital assets offered under SEC Regulations Crowdfunding (Reg CF), A, D, and S. Utility tokens can also be issued as perks or dividends to holders of security tokens, adding utility and value for investors. In 2024, we successfully introduced our platform with three Reg CF offerings. By August 2024, our white-label SaaS platform was used to launch two real estate offerings—one for $10 million under Reg A and another for $100 million under Reg D.

All investors on our platform are verified through rigorous KYC/AML processes and classified as accredited or non-accredited. This verification ensures compliance with SEC rules, including investment limits based on investor type under Reg CF and Reg A.

We are currently collaborating with financial institutions and banks across the U.S. and Latin America. To meet the growing demand for secure, private, and regulation-compliant digital asset infrastructure, Akemona is considering the development of a decentralized, permissioned blockchain. This blockchain will support our full suite of applications while enabling secure, peer-to-peer trading of security tokens among verified investors.

This permissioned network will integrate multiple KYC/AML providers and accredited investor verification services. Once verified, investors can invest and trade tokenized securities based on their regulatory status. All offerings, investments, payments, settlements, and post-issuance services will be processed through our integrated apps on this secure blockchain.

Security tokens will remain tradable only within the permissioned blockchain to preserve compliance with securities laws. However, utility tokens distributed as perks or dividends can be bridged and traded on public EVM-compatible blockchains. Akemona will offer interoperability services to facilitate this.

We support broker/dealers in tokenizing shares and facilitating compliant capital raises. This ecosystem is especially valuable for small businesses and retail investors who have traditionally avoided private securities due to high friction and low liquidity. By reducing transaction costs, increasing transparency, enabling compliance, and supporting faster settlements, we are building the future of digital finance—powered by real-world assets.
