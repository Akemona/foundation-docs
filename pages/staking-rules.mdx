# \$AKENRO Staking Protocol – Coming Soon

The staking protocol will launch after the completion of the \$AKENRO token distribution. Below is the finalized framework that governs staking, rewards, DAO governance participation, and withdrawal.

## Staking Overview

- Minimum stake: **1 \$AKENRO**
- Upon staking, users receive **stAKENRO**, a liquid staking token that:
  - Represents their staked balance
  - Accrues staking yield
  - Grants governance power
  - May be integrated into DeFi protocols (e.g., LPs, delegation tools)

## Staking Yields

All staking rewards are paid in \$AKENRO from the **Akemona Protocol Treasury**, which is funded by protocol fees and contributions from the Foundation. Rewards are distributed **weekly**, with additional **lump-sum bonuses** for fixed-duration staking.

If, during any reward distribution period, the Protocol Treasury does not have sufficient \$AKENRO to cover the full scheduled rewards, the available rewards will be prorated among eligible stakers based on their yield rates and staking durations.

There will be no retroactive carryover or adjustment of unpaid rewards. That is, if stakers receive less than their expected reward during any distribution period due to treasury shortfall, they will not receive the difference in future periods.

### Base Staking (Flexible)

- **Yield:** 8.35% APY
- **Unstake anytime**
- Weekly rewards, no bonus for long-term lock

### Fixed-Term Staking Options

| Duration | Total Yield | Structure                                                                                                                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Year   | 15.25%      | 8.35% paid weekly + annual lump sum on Day 365                                                                                                          |
| 2 Years  | 20.45%      | Year 1: same as above<br/>Year 2: 15.25% weekly + lump sum on Day 730                                                                                   |
| 3 Years  | 25.70%      | Year 1: 8.35% paid weekly + annual lump sum on Day 365<br/>Year 2: 15.25% weekly + lump sum on Day 730<br/>Year 3: 20.45% weekly + final bonus lump sum |

After the completion of a fixed-term, staking rewards revert to the base rate. To continue earning fixed-term yields, stakers must withdraw and restake their \$AKENRO tokens for a new fixed-term period.

### Early Unstaking from Fixed Terms

- If unstaking occurs **before the fixed term ends**, the staker receives rewards **based on the nearest completed milestone**:
  - \<1 year: base 8.35%
  - ≥1 year but \<2 years: 15.25%
  - ≥2 years but \<3 years: 20.45%

- Lump sum bonuses are **forfeited** if the milestone is not completed.

## Governance Participation

Staking \$AKENRO automatically enrolls you in the **Akemona DAO**, granting rights to participate in governance.

### DAO Rights via stAKENRO:

- **Proposal Submission:** Requires **100,000 stAKENRO** in wallet.
- **Voting:** stAKENRO = governance weight.
- **Proposal Rewards:** Up to **25,000 \$AKENRO** per approved proposal, disbursed quarterly.
  - Proposer must retain 100,000 stAKENRO throughout the reward cycle.

### Additional Utilities:

- stAKENRO may be integrated into:
  - Liquidity pools and DeFi strategies
  - Governance aggregators for delegated voting

## Foundation Governance

As a DAO member, you are also eligible to:

- **Run for Board election** to the Akemona Foundation
- **Vote in biannual elections** or when a seat is vacated
- **Apply for Foundation grants**, regardless of your voting weight

## Unstaking & Withdrawal

- Unstaking can be initiated **at any time** from the stAKENRO-holding wallet.
- Once initiated, a **28-day unbonding period** begins.
  - During this period:
    - Tokens are non-transferable and ineligible for rewards
    - stAKENRO are locked
    - stAKENRO must remain in your wallet to retain DAO rights

- After 28 days:
  - \$AKENRO becomes **available for manual withdrawal**
  - Tokens must be withdrawn manually to regain liquidity
  - Upon withdrawal stAKENRO are burned and $AKENRO are transferred to the wallet

## Notes & Flexibility

- Yield rates are subject to DAO governance and may be updated **twice per quarter**.
- All staking logic is **on-chain and transparent**.
- The protocol prioritizes **reward fairness**, **capital efficiency**, and **DAO-driven evolution**.
