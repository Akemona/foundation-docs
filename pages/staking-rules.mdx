# \$AKENRO Staking Protocol ‚Äì Coming Soon

The staking protocol will launch after the completion of the \$AKENRO token distribution. Below is the finalized framework that governs staking, rewards, DAO governance participation, and withdrawal.

---

## Staking Overview

* Minimum stake: **1 \$AKENRO**
* Upon staking, users receive **stAKENRO**, a liquid staking token that:

  * Represents their staked balance
  * Accrues staking yield
  * Grants governance power
  * May be integrated into DeFi protocols (e.g., LPs, delegation tools)

---

## üìà Staking Yields

All staking rewards are paid in \$AKENRO from the **Akemona Protocol Treasury**, which is funded by protocol fees and contributions from the Foundation. Rewards are distributed **weekly**, with additional **lump-sum bonuses** for fixed-duration staking.

### üü¢ Base Staking (Flexible)

* **Yield:** 8.35% APY
* **Unstake anytime**
* Weekly rewards, no bonus for long-term lock

---

### üü° Fixed-Term Staking Options

| Duration | Total Yield | Structure                                                                                                           |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 Year   | 15.25%      | 8.35% paid weekly + annual lump sum on Day 365                                                                      |
| 2 Years  | 20.45%      | Year 1: same as above<br>Year 2: 15.25% weekly + lump sum on Day 730                                                |
| 3 Years  | 25.70%      | Year 1: 8.35% paid weekly + annual lump sum on Day 365<br>Year 2: 15.25% weekly + lump sum on Day 730<br>Year 3: 20.45% weekly + final bonus lump sum |

After the completion of a fixed-term, staking rewards revert to the base rate. To continue earning fixed-term yields, stakers must withdraw and restake their \$AKENRO tokens for a new fixed-term period.

### üîÅ Early Unstaking from Fixed Terms

* If unstaking occurs **before the fixed term ends**, the staker receives rewards **based on the nearest completed milestone**:

  * <1 year: base 8.35%
  * ‚â•1 year but <2 years: 15.25%
  * ‚â•2 years but <3 years: 20.45%
* Lump sum bonuses are **forfeited** if the milestone is not completed.

## üó≥Ô∏è Governance Participation

Staking \$AKENRO automatically enrolls you in the **Akemona DAO**, granting rights to participate in governance.

### DAO Rights via stAKENRO:

* **Proposal Submission:** Requires **100,000 stAKENRO** in wallet.
* **Voting:** stAKENRO = governance weight.
* **Proposal Rewards:** Up to **25,000 \$AKENRO** per approved proposal, disbursed quarterly.

  * Proposer must retain 100,000 stAKENRO throughout the reward cycle.

### Additional Utilities:

* stAKENRO may be integrated into:

  * Liquidity pools and DeFi strategies
  * Governance aggregators for delegated voting

---

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Foundation Governance

As a DAO member, you are also eligible to:

* **Run for Board election** to the Akemona Foundation
* **Vote in biannual elections** or when a seat is vacated
* **Apply for Foundation grants**, regardless of your voting weight

---

## üîì Unstaking & Withdrawal

* Unstaking can be initiated **at any time** from the stAKENRO-holding wallet.
* Once initiated, a **28-day unbonding period** begins.

  * During this period:

    * Tokens are non-transferable and ineligible for rewards
    * stAKENRO must remain in your wallet to retain DAO rights
* After 28 days:

  * \$AKENRO becomes **available for manual withdrawal**
  * Tokens must be withdrawn manually to regain liquidity

---

## üìå Notes & Flexibility

* Yield rates are subject to DAO governance and may be updated **twice per quarter**.
* All staking logic is **on-chain and transparent**.
* The protocol prioritizes **reward fairness**, **capital efficiency**, and **DAO-driven evolution**.
