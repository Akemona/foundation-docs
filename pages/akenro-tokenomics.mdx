## 🔹 Initial Token Distribution
| Category                      | Allocation | Lockup / Vesting                        | Notes                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

✅ **Community-Controlled Tokens**:
→ **70% of all tokens** are controlled by the community (Airdrop + Treasury + Future Sale Reserve + Staking Pool)
→ Team + Advisors hold a minority interest (20%), fully locked with long vesting


## 🔹 Vesting & Anti-Rug Pull Measures
* All major token categories (Team, Advisors, Airdrop, Treasury) have **multi-year vesting schedules**.
* **Smart contract-enforced locks** to prevent early dumping.
* Treasury and reserve tokens **cannot be used without DAO approval**.


## 🔹 Launch & Initial Distribution
* **No ICO or public sale at launch**.
* **Genesis Airdrop**: All 45,000 verified users receive \$AKENRO.
* Airdrop amount per user is based on contribution score (e.g., participation, referrals, etc.)


## 🔹 Exchange Listings
* **Initial Listings**: Major DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap) + 1-2 centralized exchanges
* **Market Makers**: Hired to stabilize liquidity; tokens from liquidity bucket will vest gradually to MMs under contract.


## 🔹 Governance
* Akemona DAO formed post-launch
* 1 Board seat of Akemona Foundation is **elected annually** by \$AKENRO holders
* DAO treasury use, grants, protocol changes, and future token sale must be **approved via on-chain vote**


## 🔹 Token Release Schedule (Cumulative % Unlocked)
| Month | Circulating Supply Estimate        |
| ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| 0     | \~2% (initial airdrop, minimal MM) |
| 6     | \~10%                              |
| 12    | \~22%                              |
| 24    | \~45%                              |
| 36    | \~70%                              |
| 48+   | \~100%                             |

This ensures **gradual release** and supports **price stability**.


## 🔹 Future Token Sale
* Any public/private sale will require **DAO approval**
* Unsold tokens (from 10% sale reserve) can be **burned or redistributed** based on DAO vote


## 🔹 Optional Enhancements (Phase 2+)
* **Staking Mechanism**:
  * Stake \$AKENRO to receive **liquid stAKENRO**
  * Base yield (e.g., 8.35%), bonus yield for long-term locking (up to 25.70%)
  * stAKENRO enables DAO participation, proposal rewards, grants
* **Governance Delegation**: Token-holders can delegate votes to community leaders
* **Proposal Rewards**: Incentivize meaningful governance proposals via DAO grants


## 🔹 Summary Principles
* 🚫 **No rug pulls** — most tokens go to the community and are time-locked
* 🛡️ **Transparency** — smart contract vesting, DAO treasury control
* 🧠 **Smart design** — follows best models (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum, Uniswap)
* 🌍 **Community-first** — airdrop and governance power to Akemona users
