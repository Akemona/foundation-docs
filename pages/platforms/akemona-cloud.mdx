# Akemona Cloud

Akemona Cloud is a fully branded, white-label tokenization solution offered as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Built on the Akemona Tokenization Cloud,
this service enables businesses and financial institutions to launch and manage digital asset offerings under their own domain and brand—without
managing infrastructure or developing software.

You manage the offering. We deliver the technology—preconfigured, rebranded, and ready to deploy.
